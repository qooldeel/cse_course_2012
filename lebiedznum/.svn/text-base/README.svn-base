This is LEBNUM -- a very flat and tiny collection of C++ code snippets
used in conjunction with the course "MoSi" held at the University of Ulm.
Efforts have been made to keep the whole thing simple: no external software
is used. 

Feel free to use, improve, extend and contribute  whenever you feel to do so!!

You're heartly invited.

Addendum:
---------

If you are only interested in using the stuff, then the .hh files in the 'src'
directory mighty not interest you. 
In that case:

  1.) Go directly to the 'test' directory and set up your problem, say, 
      'myprob.cc'(*)
      
  2.) Alter the Makefile by simply replacing
      
      FILENAME = myprob 
      
      Then save it
 
  3.) On command line, execute
       
       make clean; make; ./myprob


That's it (let's suppose you don't get some error messages). 
Have fun, folks!

Footnotes:
----------

(*) a typical 'myprob.cc' example may look as follows:



#include "lebnum.hh"      //include LEBNUM sources

using namespace std;      //no need to write std::
using namespace lebnum;   //no need to write lebnum::

int main(){

    cout << "When you read this, your example has been successfully compiled" <<
    endl;

}
